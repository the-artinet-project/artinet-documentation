# Artinet Documentation

Welcome to Artinet, the comprehensive platform for creating, testing, and deploying intelligent agents that work together to solve complex problems. Whether you're building simple conversational agents or orchestrating complex multi-agent workflows, Artinet provides the tools and framework you need.

## Getting Started with Agent Creation

Artinet's **Hero Types** system makes agent creation accessible to everyone, from business users to technical developers. Instead of writing complex code, you can create powerful agents by selecting from three specialized types optimized for different roles.

### 🎭 Hero Types: The Foundation of Agent Creation

**Director Agents** - Orchestrate and manage other agents
- Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows
- Make strategic decisions and delegate tasks
- Perfect for project management and business process automation

**Worker Agents** - Execute specialized tasks with tool access
- Connect to external systems and APIs via MCP tools
- Handle data processing, analysis, and system integrations
- Ideal for technical operations and specialized computations

**Speaker Agents** - Excel at communication and content creation
- Natural language processing and conversation management
- Content creation and user interaction
- Perfect for customer service, writing, and user interfaces

### Quick Start Guide

1. **[Create Your First Agent](agents/agent-creation.md)** - Learn the Hero Types system and create agents optimized for specific roles
2. **[Test and Deploy](agents/test-and-deploy.md)** - Thoroughly test your agents and deploy them to production
3. **[Build Workflows](agents/grid-management.md)** - Use the visual Grid interface to connect agents in powerful workflows
4. **[Secure Access](agents/api-keys.md)** - Generate and manage API keys for secure agent interactions

## Why Choose Artinet's Hero Types?

**✅ No Coding Required**: Create sophisticated agents using our intuitive interface and Hero Type templates

**✅ Optimized Performance**: Each Hero Type is optimized for its specific role and use case

**✅ Better Collaboration**: Agents understand each other's capabilities through standardized Hero Types

**✅ Scalable Architecture**: Easily build from simple single-agent solutions to complex multi-agent ecosystems

**✅ Rapid Development**: Go from concept to deployed agent in minutes, not days

## Featured Workflows

### Business Process Automation
Use a **Director** to coordinate:
- **Worker** agents for data processing and system integration
- **Speaker** agents for customer communication and notifications
- Complete automation of complex business workflows

### Content Production Pipeline
Create sophisticated content workflows:
- **Director** manages editorial calendar and assigns tasks
- **Worker** agents research and gather data from various sources  
- **Speaker** agents create, edit, and publish content across channels

### Customer Service Excellence
Build comprehensive customer support:
- **Speaker** agents handle initial customer interactions
- **Worker** agents access customer data and process requests
- **Director** escalates and coordinates complex issue resolution

## Advanced Development

For developers who need complete control over agent behavior and want to build custom solutions from the ground up, Artinet provides a comprehensive SDK.

### 🔧 Custom Agent Development (Advanced)

The Artinet SDK is designed for advanced or custom agent creation scenarios where the Hero Types system doesn't fully meet your specific requirements. While Hero Types are recommended for most use cases, the SDK provides:

**Complete Customization**: Build agents with exact specifications for unique requirements

**Low-Level Control**: Direct access to the Agent2Agent protocol and communication layers

**Custom Integrations**: Create specialized integrations beyond standard MCP tools

**Research and Experimentation**: Prototype new agent behaviors and interaction patterns

> **💡 Recommendation**: Most users should start with Hero Types, as they're likely to be better supported and more compatible with the broader Artinet ecosystem. Consider the SDK only when Hero Types cannot meet your specific requirements.

## Platform Features

### Visual Grid Interface
- **Drag-and-Drop Workflows**: Create complex multi-agent systems visually
- **Real-Time Testing**: Test individual agents and complete workflows
- **Save and Share**: Store workflow templates and share with team members

### Comprehensive Testing
- **Sandbox Environment**: Safe testing environment for all agent types
- **End-to-End Validation**: Test complete workflows before deployment

### Integration Ecosystem
- **MCP Tools**: Extensive library of tools for Worker agents
- **External APIs**: Connect to any REST API or webhook

## Architecture Overview

Artinet is built on the **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol**, enabling secure, efficient communication between agents regardless of their implementation or location. This architecture provides:

- **Decentralized Operation**: Agents can run anywhere while maintaining coordination
- **Secure Communication**: Built-in authentication and encryption
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: From single agents to thousands of coordinated agents
- **Standard Protocols**: Open standards enable interoperability and extensibility
