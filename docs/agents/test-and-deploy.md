# Test and Deploy

Once you've created your agent, thorough testing is essential before deployment. This guide covers the complete testing and deployment process, ensuring your agent performs reliably in production environments.

## Testing Your Agent

### Pre-Deployment Testing

Before deploying your agent to the live environment, use Artinet's built-in testing features to validate functionality and performance.

#### Test Environment Access
Navigate to your agent's dashboard and select **"Test Mode"** to access the sandboxed testing environment. This provides:
- Isolated testing environment
- Safe space for validation without affecting production
- Access to simulated tools and integrations
- Performance monitoring during tests

#### Testing Different Scenarios

**For Director Agents:**
- Test multi-agent coordination scenarios
- Validate task delegation capabilities  
- Check decision-making logic with various inputs
- Ensure proper workflow orchestration

**For Worker Agents:**
- Test all configured MCP tools and integrations
- Validate data processing with sample datasets
- Check API connections and error handling
- Ensure tool authentication is working properly

**For Speaker Agents:**
- Test conversational flows with various user inputs
- Validate content generation quality and consistency
- Check response appropriateness and tone
- Test edge cases and unexpected inputs

### Testing Best Practices

#### Input Validation Testing
1. **Valid Inputs**: Test with expected input formats and content
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary conditions and unusual but valid inputs
3. **Invalid Inputs**: Ensure graceful handling of incorrect or malformed inputs
4. **Empty/Null Inputs**: Verify behavior with missing or empty data

#### Integration Testing
- **Tool Connectivity**: Verify all MCP tools are accessible and functional
- **API Responses**: Test with real API responses and simulated failures
- **Data Flow**: Ensure data passes correctly between agent and external systems
- **Authentication**: Validate all security tokens and access permissions

#### Performance Testing
- **Response Time**: Monitor agent response times under various loads
- **Resource Usage**: Check memory and processing requirements
- **Concurrent Operations**: Test handling of multiple simultaneous requests
- **Timeout Handling**: Ensure proper behavior when external services are slow

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
Before deploying your agent, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass successfully
- [ ] Agent Skills and Description are clear and actionable
- [ ] Required integrations are properly configured
- [ ] Security settings are appropriate for the intended use
- [ ] Performance metrics meet expected requirements
- [ ] Error handling is implemented for all failure scenarios

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Review Configuration
Double-check all agent settings:
- **Hero Type** is appropriate for intended role
- **Model settings** match performance requirements  
- **Integration access** is properly configured
- **Security permissions** follow principle of least privilege

#### 2. Deploy to Production
1. Navigate to your agent's dashboard
2. Click **"Deploy to Production"**
3. Review deployment summary
4. Confirm deployment settings
5. Monitor deployment progress

#### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment:
- Verify agent appears in **"My Agents"** section
- Test basic functionality in production environment
- Monitor initial performance metrics
- Check integration connectivity

### My Agents Dashboard

After successful deployment, your agent will be visible in the **"My Agents"** section of your dashboard. Here you can:

#### Agent Management
- **Status Monitoring**: View agent health and availability
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor response times and success rates
- **Usage Statistics**: Track agent interactions and workload
- **Error Logs**: Review any issues or failures

#### Configuration Updates
- **Settings Modification**: Update agent parameters without redeployment
- **Integration Management**: Add, remove, or modify tool connections
- **Access Control**: Manage who can interact with your agent
- **Version Control**: Track changes and rollback if needed

#### Workflow Integration
- **Grid Visibility**: Your deployed agents become available for grid workflows
- **Connection Status**: Monitor connections to other agents
- **Collaboration Metrics**: Track multi-agent interactions

## Post-Deployment Best Practices

### Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Performance Monitoring
- Set up alerts for performance degradation
- Monitor resource usage trends
- Track error rates and response times
- Review usage patterns regularly

#### Regular Updates
- Keep agent skills and descriptions current
- Update integrations as APIs change
- Refine prompts based on real-world usage
- Apply security patches promptly

#### User Feedback
- Collect feedback from agent interactions
- Monitor satisfaction scores
- Identify areas for improvement
- Iterate based on real usage patterns

### Scaling Considerations

As your agent usage grows:
- **Resource Allocation**: Monitor and adjust compute resources
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate usage limits
- **Load Distribution**: Consider deploying multiple instances
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently requested operations

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Agent Not Appearing in My Agents
- Check deployment completion status
- Verify account permissions
- Refresh browser cache
- Contact support if issue persists

#### Integration Failures
- Verify API keys and authentication tokens
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Review integration logs for specific error messages
- Test integrations individually in test mode

#### Performance Issues
- Monitor resource usage during peak times
- Check for inefficient operations or queries
- Review model settings and adjust if necessary
- Consider optimizing prompts for better performance

## Advanced Deployment Options

### Blue-Green Deployment
For critical agents, consider blue-green deployments:
1. Deploy new version alongside existing version
2. Test new version with limited traffic
3. Gradually shift traffic to new version
4. Retire old version after validation

### Staged Rollout
- Deploy to test environment first
- Limited production rollout to subset of users
- Monitor metrics and gather feedback
- Full rollout after validation

### Rollback Procedures
Always have a rollback plan:
- Keep previous working version available
- Document rollback procedures
- Set up automated rollback triggers for critical failures
- Test rollback procedures regularly

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
- [Grid Management](grid-management.md) - Learn about workflow integration
- [API Key Management](api-keys.md) - Secure your agent access
- [Hero Types](hero-types.md) - Deep dive into the three agent types
