# Test and Deploy

While creating your agent, thorough testing is essential before deployment. This guide covers the complete testing and deployment process, ensuring your agent performs reliably in production environments.

## Testing Your Agent

### Pre-Deployment Testing

Before deploying your agent to the live environment, use Artinet's built-in testing features to validate functionality and performance.

1. Use the Test prompt textbox for adding one or more test inputs for your agent by clicking the "plus" button to submit them
2. Once your test input(s) are ready, click **Test**
3. Watch the deployment and result
4. Iterate your design until you're satisfied

### Testing Best Practices

#### Input Validation Testing
1. **Valid Inputs**: Test with expected input formats and content
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary conditions and unusual but valid inputs

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
Before deploying your agent, ensure:

- [ ] You're satified with your testing results
- [ ] Agent Skills and Description are clear and actionable
- [ ] Required integrations are properly configured
- [ ] All required fields are filled in appropriately

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Deploy to Production
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Confirm Deployment is successful

**Note**: if deployment fails its usually because the agent information, creator and version number are all the same as an already deployed agent

#### 2. Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment:
- Verify agent appears in **"My Agents"** section
- Test basic functionality in production environment

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
- [Grid Management](grid-management.md) - Learn about workflow integration
- [API Key Management](api-keys.md) - Generate keys
- [Hero Types](hero-types.md) - Deep dive into the three agent types

> **ðŸš€ Deployment Success**: Once deployed, your agent becomes part of the broader Artinet ecosystem and can collaborate with other agents to solve complex problems.
