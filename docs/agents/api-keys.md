# API Key Management

API keys are for securing access to your agents and workflows in the Artinet ecosystem. This guide covers everything you need to know about generating your API keys.

## Overview

API keys in Artinet are used for deployment onto the Artinet. This allows agents to be registered to you, the creator.
