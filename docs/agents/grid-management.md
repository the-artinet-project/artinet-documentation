# Grid Management

The Agent Grid is Artinet's visual workflow builder that allows you to create complex, multi-agent systems by connecting agents in sophisticated workflows. This guide covers everything you need to know about managing agents within the grid environment.

## Overview

The Agent Grid provides a drag-and-drop interface for:
- Adding existing agents to workflows
- Creating new agents directly in workflows
- Connecting agents through visual relationships
- Testing complex multi-agent scenarios
- Saving and loading workflow configurations

## Adding Agents to the Grid

### Adding Existing Agents

You can add any of your deployed agents to the grid workflow:

1. **Access Agent Library**: Click the **"Add Agent"** button in the grid interface
2. **Browse Available Agents**: View all your deployed agents from "My Agents"
3. **Filter by Type**: Use filters to find specific hero types (Director, Worker, Speaker)
4. **Drag to Grid**: Simply drag the desired agent onto the grid canvas
5. **Position and Configure**: Place the agent node where you want it in your workflow

**Agent Information Display**:
- Agent name and type
- Current status (active/inactive)
- Available connections
- Resource usage indicators

### Adding New Agents

Create new agents directly within the grid environment:

1. **Click "New Agent"**: Select the new agent option in the grid
2. **Quick Creation Form**: Fill out essential fields (name, type, basic skills)
3. **Rapid Configuration**: Set up basic parameters optimized for grid use
4. **Immediate Integration**: Agent becomes available in the current workflow
5. **Refine Later**: Access full configuration options from the agent's context menu

**Grid-Optimized Creation**:
- Streamlined form with essential fields only
- Pre-configured settings for common workflow patterns  
- Automatic connection suggestions based on grid context
- Immediate testing capabilities

## Connecting Agents

### Drag Connection System

The grid uses an intuitive drag-and-drop system for creating agent connections:

#### For Director Agents
Directors can manage multiple Worker and Speaker agents:

1. **Connection Points**: Director agents show multiple output connection points
2. **Drag to Connect**: Drag from Director's output to target agent's input
3. **Connection Types**: Different connection types for different interaction patterns
4. **Validation**: System validates connection compatibility automatically

**Connection Types for Directors**:
- **Task Delegation**: Send specific tasks to Worker agents
- **Information Request**: Query agents for status or results  
- **Coordination**: Manage multi-agent collaborations
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute resources among connected agents

#### Agent-to-Agent Connections
Create direct connections between any compatible agents:

1. **Output Ports**: Each agent shows available output connection points
2. **Input Ports**: Compatible agents show matching input points
3. **Smart Suggestions**: System highlights potential connection targets
4. **Connection Rules**: Visual feedback for valid/invalid connections

**Connection Validation**:
- Data type compatibility checking
- Hero type relationship validation
- Circular dependency prevention
- Resource conflict detection

### Connection Management

**Editing Connections**:
- **Right-click connection**: Access connection properties
- **Connection Settings**: Configure data flow parameters
- **Connection Labels**: Add descriptions for complex workflows
- **Conditional Logic**: Set up conditional connection rules

**Connection Monitoring**:
- **Data Flow Indicators**: Visual representation of information flow
- **Performance Metrics**: Connection throughput and latency
- **Error Indicators**: Visual alerts for connection problems
- **Traffic Analytics**: Historical data flow analysis

## Testing Within Grid

### Grid Testing Capabilities

The grid provides comprehensive testing for multi-agent workflows:

#### Director Testing Requirements
**Important**: Directors can only be fully tested if their connected child agents are deployed:

- **Deployment Check**: System verifies all connected agents are deployed
- **Warning System**: Clear indicators when child agents are not ready
- **Partial Testing**: Test Director logic with simulated responses
- **Full Integration**: Complete testing once all agents are deployed

#### Testing Modes

**Individual Agent Testing**:
- Test single agents within grid context
- Validate agent responses with grid-specific inputs
- Monitor performance in workflow environment
- Debug agent behavior in isolation

**Workflow Testing**:
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete workflows from start to finish
- **Step-by-Step Testing**: Execute workflows in stages for debugging
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high-volume scenarios
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Test error handling and recovery

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Happy Path**: Test normal workflow execution
- **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- **Failure Recovery**: Test agent failure and recovery scenarios
- **Performance Limits**: Test with maximum expected loads

### Test Execution

1. **Select Test Mode**: Choose individual agent or full workflow testing
2. **Configure Test Data**: Set up test inputs and expected outcomes
3. **Run Tests**: Execute tests with real-time monitoring
4. **Review Results**: Analyze test outcomes and performance metrics
5. **Debug Issues**: Use built-in debugging tools to resolve problems

## Saving and Loading Workflows
